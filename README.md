# NodeExpressTestWebsite

By Marcus Barnes

This is a very basic website built with Node/Express.js

Go take a look at https://basicexpress217.herokuapp.com/

- The contact page contains a form that allows visitors to send a message
	to the website owner's email address using the nodemailer npm package.
